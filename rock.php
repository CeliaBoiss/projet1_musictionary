                <p>Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States 
                in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and 
                later, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues, 
                rhythm and blues, and from country music.</p>
                <p>Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and 
                incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. </p>

                    <p class="hide">For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a 
                    rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with 
                    a 4/4 time signature using a verseâ€“chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse.</p>
